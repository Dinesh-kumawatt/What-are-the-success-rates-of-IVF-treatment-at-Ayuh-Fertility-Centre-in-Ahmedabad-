When it comes to IVF, most couples always ask the same important question â€“ "What are the chances it will work?" Thatâ€™s a fair thing to ask because IVF can be emotionally and financially exhausting. At Ayuh Fertility Centre in Ahmedabad, the IVF success rate is considered to be quite good compared to many other clinics in India. It really depends on different things like the womanâ€™s age, the cause of infertility, the quality of the eggs and sperm, and how well the embryo implants.

Dr. Krupa Shah, who is the leading doctor at Ayuh, has over 16 years of experience and has treated thousands of patients. According to many patient reviews and reports, the centre has seen success rates as high as 70â€“80% in some cycles, especially with younger women. But letâ€™s be real â€“ not every IVF cycle leads to pregnancy. Sometimes it works on the first go, sometimes couples may need two or even three attempts. But the good part is that the clinic is honest with patients. They explain everything clearly â€“ like how age affects fertility, why some embryos may not implant, and what to expect after embryo transfer.

One thing that helps increase their success rate is their modern IVF lab. The clinic uses advanced technology and keeps the lab environment super clean and precise. They also freeze embryos if extra good ones are formed, so couples can try again without going through the whole cycle again. That helps reduce cost and stress.

Ayuh also offers support like counselling, nutrition advice, and medical monitoring throughout the process. They track hormone levels, do regular ultrasounds, and even help reduce stress through gentle guidance. All of this adds to better results.

Still, no IVF centre in the world can give 100% guarantee. But Ayuh Fertility Centre really focuses on personalised care and evidence-based treatments, which often leads to better success than going to a generic fertility clinic.

So, if youâ€™re thinking about IVF and want to know whether your chances are good, you should visit the centre or book a consultation. The doctors there will take time to look into your personal history and suggest the right fertility plan.
